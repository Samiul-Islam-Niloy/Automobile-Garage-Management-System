# Automobile Garage Management System

CSE 3224 : Database Lab

A database management system project. Garage owners can manage their garage using this. Outgoing/ingoing/in-service cars with their owners can be seen. Also car owners can see whether their cars are done or not. They will get notification when they are done. They can also pre-book for a spot. Lastly, after servicing, a receipt will be printed with their expenses written.
